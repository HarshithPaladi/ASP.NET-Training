Text Editors or Document Editors are widely used software to write, edit and save content. These software are mostly used by students for their academic works, employees for office works, business people for various written business transactions, and there are other many more fields where Text Editors are used.

In recent years, the typical documentation platform we were familiar with, Microsoft Word is not the only option for text edition and documentation. Google Docs have helped users manage documents and records more effectively using cloud feature.  Documents can be modified from different locations and the modifications can be saved. Also, the same file can be downloaded from many locations.

So, the entire text edition and documentation process, or the typical offline text editor software has now evolved as a web-based application. This proposed Online Text Editor project is a similar one developed in ASP.NET framework.
